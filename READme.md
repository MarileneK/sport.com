# Sport.com

## Description
Sport.com is a responsive webpage which looks like an e-commerce shop.

The aim was to put into practice my HTML & CSS knowledge, but also to make it responsive (breakpoint at 768px).

(Exercise given during my intensive coursework in coding @WebForce3. You can find the mock-ups in the folder: images < mock-ups.)

## Technos
